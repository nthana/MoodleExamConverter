This program convert my user-defined exam format (easier to create/read) into the Moodle Multi-Choice format.

1) Normal text line: does not start with ""letter + dot + space"" (ex. ""a. "")
2) Choice line: starts with a letter + dot + space (ex. ""a. "")
A choice line can have more than one choice.

The correct answer should be marked with '*'. (ex. ""*a. "")
